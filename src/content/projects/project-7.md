**Team**: Samantha Chu (Software Engineer), Brenda L. (PM), Shannon N. (UXD)

**Project Overview:**
Business Insider has a large repository of Pitch Decks readily available, but the UX poses a challenge for users who hope to utilize it. By having the pitch deck repository in a list form embedded in a larger article with limited search capabilities, users have a harder time finding the information they need from the tool quickly. Thereâ€™s also increased friction in actually seeing the slide contents, as users have to click to the individual article page and then scroll through the page to view content due to the limitation of our slideshow format.

**Solution Opportunity**
By creating an easier UX for users to search and preview the pitch decks, we will encourage return visits and increased usage of this tool, which will in turn generate user value and loyalty.  

**Goals and Metrics to determine success**
1. Clicks to view individual pitch decks
2. Return visits to the Pitch Deck hub

## Objectives

1. **Improve User Experience for Searching and Browsing Pitch Decks:**
- Enhance the search functionality to allow users to quickly find relevant pitch decks based on keywords or categories.
- Organize pitch decks in a more user-friendly way to make browsing intuitive and streamlined.
2. **Enable Quick Preview of Pitch Decks:**
- Allow users to preview pitch decks without the need to click through multiple pages.
- Reduce friction by minimizing the number of steps needed to access the deck contents, improving content visibility. 
3. **Increase User Engagement and Return Visits:**
- Design the interface to encourage return visits by making it easier to discover and interact with pitch decks.
- Implement features that enhance the overall value of the tool to promote user loyalty.
4. **Improve Accessibility and Navigation:**
- Simplify navigation within the pitch deck hub to make it easier to move between decks and explore related content.
- Ensure that the design is responsive across devices to cater to a diverse range of users.

## Features

1. **Advanced Search Functionality**

- Add robust filtering and sorting options for pitch decks, allowing users to search by industry, funding round, and region (location).

2. **Instant Pitch Deck Previews**

- Enable users to preview the contents of a pitch deck directly from the search results page or hub without navigating away.
- Display slide thumbnails or summaries to allow for quick assessment of deck relevance.

## Technology Stack

- Frontend: Handlebars, SCSS, and client JS for a responsive and interactive user interface.
- Backend: Node JS for server-side logic and API integration.
- Database: Spreadsheet API (in-house) for efficient storage and retrieval of company data.

## Outcome

The redesigned Pitch Deck Library is expected to significantly improve user experience when interacting with Pitch Deck content. Our team presented the prototype to the Business Insider Product & Tech organization during the 2024 Hack Week, and the project was awarded the Business Insider 2024 Hackathon award for "Best Job To Be Done".

Key features, such as advanced search functionality and instant deck previews, aim to reduce friction in accessing content, which will provide users with a more efficient and intuitive browsing experience. These improvements are expected to drive increased engagement, with higher clicks on individual pitch decks and a boost in return visits to the Pitch Deck hub. The project has laid the groundwork for greater user satisfaction and tool adoption, demonstrating measurable improvements in user interaction.
